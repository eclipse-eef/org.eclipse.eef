h2. Markdown

h3(#description). Description

The Markdown widget is used to display values that can be represented as Markdown content. On top of the common properties of all widgets (identifier, labelExpression, helpExpression, isEnabledExpression, propertyValidationRules), it has the following properties:

* _valueExpression_: This expression is used to compute the value to display. This expression must return a string.
* _editExpression_: This expression will be executed when the user will change the focus after typing some content in the text field. This expression is executed if an Operation is provided under the widget. The current value of the text field will be accessible in a variable named @newValue@. The variable @newValue@ is a @java.lang.String@. This expression does not have to return anything. 
* _numberOfLine_ : The number of lines to be displayed, which determines the height of the _Markdown_ widget. Use @1@ for a single line text field or @5@ (for example) for a multiline text field.

EEF does not provide a default interpreter but you can easily configure EEF to be used with the AQL interpreter. In the integration of EEF with the AQL interpreter, you can register additional services, written in Java, in which you can expose to AQL new operations. The operation @eSet(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)@ used in the example does not exist in AQL. You would have to create it yourself.
