h2. Label

h3(#description). Description

The label widget can be used to display a read-only piece of text in your user interface. Its behavior is almost the same as the "text":text.html widget. On top of the common properties of all widgets (identifier, labelExpression, helpExpression, isEnabledExpression, propertyValidationRules), it has the following properties:

* valueExpression: The value expression is used to compute the body of the label widget. This expression must return a string.
* style: The style of the label widget.
* conditionalStyle: All the conditional styles of the label widget.

h3(#displayreadonlyestringeattribute). Display a read-only EString EAttribute

In order to display in the user interface a label with the value of a read-only EAttribute with the eType EString, you can create a label widget with the following properties:

* labelExpression: @aql:'Documentation'@
* valueExpression: @aql:self.documentation@

EEF does not provide a default interpreter but you can easily configure EEF to be used with the AQL interpreter. In the integration of EEF with the AQL interpreter, you can register additional services, written in Java, in which you can expose to AQL new operations. The operation @eSet(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)@ used in the example does not exist in AQL. You would have to create it yourself.
