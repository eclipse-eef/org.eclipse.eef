	Chapter Introduction {
		The *Extended Editing Framework* is a presentation framework for the Eclipse Modeling Framework. It allows user to create rich user interfaces to edit EMF models.

		Editing models is an important task for the tools developed with EMF. EEF enables you to produce more usable user interface to edit EMF models via a generative process. EEF generates by default JFace wizards and properties views to edit your models but you can use the generated interfaces in any kind of your UI parts.
		EEF is a good EMF world citizen, all customizations done on the EMF layer are integrated in the EEF interfaces. Frameworks like EMF Validation, EMF Transaction, ... natively work with EEF.

	Chapter Features {
		EEF comes with three components:
		- A runtime providing a standard MVC architecture specially designed to create EMF editing forms.
		- A code generator able to produce Views and Wizard dedicated to your very specific models
		- A UI modeling environment helping you to design your views.

				Section Standard "SWT" Toolkit {
					The SWT is composed of 7 widgets:
						- Text
						- TextArea
						- Checkbox
						- Radio
						- Combo
						- Group
						- Hbox
					The text	widget enables users to edit _EAttributes_ by entering a String value. The standard use case is to edit an EAttribute haved a EString. For instance, in this scenario, an user is able do defines the firstname of conference participant using a text widget:
					@M
						@ref "intent:/org.eclipse.emf.eef.scenarios.idoc/setAttributeText.modelingbot"
						 
						@ref "org.eclipse.emf.eef.scenarios.idoc/src/org/eclipse/emf/eef/scenarios/idoc/scenarios/SetAttributeTextTest.java"
						 
					M@

					An interisting fact is that EEF invoke the EMF method _createFromString_ on the entered value. So with a text widget you can edit any kind of _EAttribute_ if theirs type can be created from a String. In this second scenario, a text widget is used to edit the age of a participant:
					@M
						@ref "intent:/org.eclipse.emf.eef.scenarios.idoc/setIntegerAttributeText.modelingbot"
						 
						@ref "org.eclipse.emf.eef.scenarios.idoc/src/org/eclipse/emf/eef/scenarios/idoc/scenarios/SetIntegerAttributeTextTest.java"
						 
					M@
				}
